# Linear-1st-Order-PDE-Method-of-Characteristics
Program for calculating numerical solutions for linear 1st order partial differential equations.
I designed this algorithm in my bachelor thesis.

## Project structure
### Source code
All source code files can be found in the `/src` directory. The algorithm is written in *Matlab*. 

### Documentation
Documentation with detailed description about the algorithm and its usage is provided in the `Documentation.pdf` file.

## Essential software
To use this programme, you need to own a *Matlab* programming language license. If you are from my university (Charles university, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics), you can have it for free (more on this [website](https://www.mff.cuni.cz/cs/math/vnitrni-zalezitosti/pocitace-a-technika/matlab)) I wrote the programme using Matlab version 2024a. In might not work properly on other versions. So if that's your case, download Matlab 2024a.

Then you could use a free graphics software *Paraview*, where you will be able to render 3D approximated solutions in high quality. If you decide to do so, download the latest version of Paraview from [here](https://www.paraview.org/download/). However, downloading Paraview is an optional choice. You can see a little bit less detailed 3D graphs in Matlab.
